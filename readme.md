### FizzBuzz Exercise
FizzBuzz is a simple number game where you count, but say "Fizz" and/or "Buzz" instead of numbers adhering to certain rules.

Create a FizzBuzz() method that prints out the numbers 1 through 100.
Instead of numbers divisible by three print "Fizz".
Instead of numbers divisible by five print "Buzz".
Instead of numbers divisible by three and five print "FizzBuzz".


### Prime Factors Exercise
Write a method generate(int n) that given an integer N will return a list of integers such that the numbers are the factors of N and are arranged in increasing numerical order.

For example, generate(1) should return an empty list and generate(30) should return the numbers: 2,3,5.
